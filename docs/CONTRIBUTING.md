# welcome to nix-snippets! 

Thank you for putting time into making this project better!

This guide briefly covers the goal of the project and how to contribute.


## goal

nix-snippets aims to gather a community collection of snippets of the Nix expression language.

Then, anyone interested in Nix can increase their confidence and proficiency in the Nix expression language by using this repository in a self-directed fashion.

### non-goals

Despite the harsh sounding "non-goals", I simply want to differentiate this project from other noble efforts.  

Beginner focused tutorials are wonderful but require extensive time and resource investment. 
So this project *is not* a tutorial. 

Complex expressions for packaging and general "do this thing in Nix" are also wonderful.
But this project wants to be accessible to beginners.
Complex examples suit expert users.



## contribution guidelines
